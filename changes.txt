Ive never coded or modded a game before. Still getting around to learning how to mod the game, so far im doing good progress, but still a lot to do and learn!

If you already are familiar with modding the game, I encourage you to make a mod of a similar party, like it has been done with the PSI in Biennio Rosso already. It has been my inspiration to try and make one about PSOE.
